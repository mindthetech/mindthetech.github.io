# Mind the Tech?

Our goal is to share our knowledge and grow together.
We believe that to achieve success we need to work on three pillars: `Technology`, `People` and `Processes`.

More than that, we believe we need to share and work on a team - even you lone wolf developers - to achieve more. Over the years we encountered many smart people from which we learned a lot.

**Mind the Tech** is our approach to share what we learned and create a community-driven set of frameworks that can help to reduce the time-to-result in technology-related initiatives. We're talking about a curated and trusted set of seed repos and a space to share best practices and foster leaning and growth.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mindthetech/mindthetech.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mindthetech/mindthetech.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Mind the Tech?

Our goal is to share our knowledge and grow together.
We believe that to achieve success we need to work on three pillars: `Technology`, `People` and `Processes`.

More than that, we believe we need to share and work on a team - even you lone wolf developers - to achieve more. Over the years we encountered many smart people from which we learned a lot.

**Mind the Tech** is our approach to share what we learned and create a community-driven set of frameworks that can help to reduce the time-to-result in technology-related initiatives. We're talking about a curated and trusted set of seed repos and a space to share best practices and foster leaning and growth.

There is more to come!
